# Hello.

# This is my course project for the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" at coursera.

## This project contains the following files.
1. README.md (this one, for explain about this project)
2. run_analysis.R (R code for run the analysis and product a tidy dataset which is the file in number 3)
3. tidy_dataset.txt (a tidy dataset produced from run_analysis.R)
4. codebook.md (the codebook for explaining tidy_dataset.txt)

### How to run "run_analysis.R"

I have tested the code on my environment which is  
  * Windows 10 Pro 64-bits
  * R-3.3.0 64-bits
  * RStudio 0.99.902

Please edit the variable "workingDirectory" in the first line of the code to be your working directory on your environment (make sure you have a permission to write on the workingdirectory).
Then just run the entire code. It will begin by downloading and unziping data, then it will read data and do the analysis. Finally, it will produce the output file name "tidy_dataset.txt" located in the working directory.

Thank You.
